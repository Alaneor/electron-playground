# React Playground

> I don't know what this is, what it was or what it will be. But it's a lot of fun!

## About

This is an Electron application built with React and Redux. As a theme, I chose PhotonKit because I do not want to spend hours fiddling around with CSS. ðŸ‘Ž And I do not care about Windows or Linux compatibility at this time. ðŸ˜‡

## Building & running

As usual, clone this repo and `cd` into it. From there, it's as trivial as

```
npm i
./bin/run
```

You can also make use of the following `make` targets:

- `compile`: Compiles all sources with Babel
- `test`: Runs tests with Mocha
- `lint`: Lints all source files with ESLint
- `distclean`: Deletes all `.js` and `.js.map` files, basically all the compiled stuff
